The following content was originally posted [on my old blog](http://archlever.blogspot.com/2005/10/lever-that-rocks-our-world.html) on 18 October 2005. An eternity ago, as blogs go. The content is reformatted from ancient HTML, but is otherwise unchanged (including use of then-locally-appropriate English dialect). Enjoy.

The ancient Greek philosopher Archimedes is quoted as [having said](http://www.mcs.drexel.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Lever/LeverQuotes.html)

> Give me a place to stand and with a lever I will move the whole world.

We're not here to attempt anything on that scale, but being involved in IT often feels that way.

This blog is one of the vehicles which I intend to use to record, discuss and build upon various projects, ideas and [memes](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/meme) which I believe important in the context of a modern software-development organisation. By the term "software-development organisation", I am also including groups which create Web applications and content, [podcasts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcasting), or similar "media" artifacts which rely on some form of computer or other electronic technology for distribution.
