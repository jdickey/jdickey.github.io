### [Lotus — A complete web framework for Ruby](http://lotusrb.org)

This just earned a place high atop my “Tools to Evaluate” list; largely due to the overall description in the main project [README](https://github.com/lotus/lotus/blob/master/README.md), and utterly _cemented_ by this bit in the `Lotus::View` [README](https://github.com/lotus/view/blob/master/README.md):

> It’s based on a **separation between views and templates**.
>
> A view is an object that encapsulates the presentation logic of a page. A template is a file that defines the semantic and visual elements of a page. In order to show a result to an user, a template must be rendered by a view.

No more inscrutable magic in Rails view handling! **Thank you!**
