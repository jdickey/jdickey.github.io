### [Daniel O'Connor: Rails, how developers grow, and what's wrong with it](http://clockwerx.blogspot.com.au/2014/04/rails-how-developers-grow-and-whats.html)

Rails isn’t _yet_ to the point where it’s imploding large segments of the software-development industry. But those who had cause to know and loathe the circuses that overran VB6 and, later, PHP, have more than sufficient cause for grave concern.

And no, when the majority of the articles I find interesting _as a Rails practitioner_ have titles like this, or [<cite>ActiveRecord (and Rails) Considered Harmful</cite>](http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2011-12-30-active-record-considered-harmful), I _don’t_ think I’m being overly dramatic.
