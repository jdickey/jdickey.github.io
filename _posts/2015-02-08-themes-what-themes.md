Wikipedia [defines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_(computing)) *theme* as "a preset package containing graphical appearance details". Jekyll Bootstrap has a wonderful-sounding [page](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/usage/jekyll-theming.html) on "Using Themes", implying a meaning of "theme" consistent with the Wikipedia definition. The Jekyll Bootstrap [home page](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) claims that "Jekyll Bootstrap is the first Jekyll blogging engine to support modular theming."  It's too bad that the [theme browser](http://themes.jekyllbootstrap.com/) includes a mere half-dozen themes that are several years old. A Github search for [`jekyll theme`](https://github.com/search?p=3&q=jekyll+theme&type=Repositories&utf8=âœ“) yields over 550 repository results &mdash; which appear to be *forks of a Jekyll installation with asset and config changes applied*.

Not what most people (or most developers/designers, at least) think a "theme" is.

So why aren't there gobs of *standalone, installable* themes out there? How come the world seems to have ended in 2012 for Jekyll theming? (Were the Mayans onto something after all?) The Jekyll Bootstrap docs have [a nice write-up](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/api/theme-api.html) of the Theme API, *Version 0.1.0*, which recommends that the would-be theme author "[view] and study the repos for current published themes", linking to a [moribund Github repo](http://github.com/jekyllbootstrap/).

What happened?
