One of the gravest injuries suffered by recent generations of developers was sub-standard compiler vendors marketing their schlock as “C/C++” until they got their house in order, `Visual` or otherwise. C++ is to C roughly as C is to assembler, except in reverse. That is, instead of asking “Which C” (for “which assembler”, as 68000 is _very_ different than 8086…), the question is “which C++”. One of the thorniest questions any C++ shop, or project, has to answer is “what subset of the language do we use, since nobody except (possibly, as a theoretical exercise at most) Stroustrup has ever used even a statistically-significant subset of the whole thing?”_

C++ is the [PL/I](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/I) of our time.
