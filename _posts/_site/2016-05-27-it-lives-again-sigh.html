<p>If you can see this, you’re <em>not</em> too close; we’re just back on the air with GitHub Pages.</p>

<p><a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> itself is a surprisingly straightforward blogging system, considering the fact that every single Jekyll blog in existence is a fork of someone <em>else’s</em> blog (including templates which are blogs stripped of content). Attempting to customise them haphasardly, especially when combined with the niceties of Github Pages, however, gives one a finely-crafted weapon of mass distraction. The target of that distraction will likely be yourself; I’m still experimenting here, but I’ve finally found a “theme” (content-free template) <a href="https://github.com/dbtek/dbyll">dbyll</a> by <a href="https://github.com/dbtek">@dbtek</a> (İsmail Demirbilek) that has the features I’ve been looking for from plugins (which aren’t supported by GitHub Pages): tags, categories, enhanced contact info, and (coming soon), my CV.</p>

<p>In the meantime, let me know how this looks, and enjoy your voyage aboard Kobayashi Maru. What is this, our fifth tour?</p>
