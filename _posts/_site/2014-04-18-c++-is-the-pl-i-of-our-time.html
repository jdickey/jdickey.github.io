  <p>Learning Java is so weird because it’s based in C and I learned C++ about 7 years ago and mostly forgot, so now I’m just remembering this vague distant memory but everything I do now is different. </p>

  <p>Why can’t we all just cout« and cin»?</p>

<p>One of the gravest injuries suffered by recent generations of developers was sub-standard compiler vendors marketing their schlock as “C/C++” until they got their house in order, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Visual</code> or otherwise. C++ is to C roughly as C is to assembler, except in reverse. That is, instead of asking “Which C” (for “which assembler”, as 68000 is <em>very</em> different than 8086…), the question is “which C++”. One of the thorniest questions any C++ shop, or project, has to answer is “what subset of the language do we use, since nobody except (possibly, as a theoretical exercise at most) Stroustrup has ever used even a statistically-significant subset of the whole thing?”_</p>

<p>C++ is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/I">PL/I</a> of our time.</p>
