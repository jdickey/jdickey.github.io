  <p>I wonder how hard it would be to make the jump from C++ to Python and/or Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>You’ll get the basics quickly enough, but extensive C++ experience actively inhibits your ability to think in terms of dynamic OO as used in Ruby or even Python. The way you <em>should</em> think about “good” design is just that different. No matter what subset of C++ you’re used to (<em>nobody</em> uses the entirety; perhaps a few dozen people in the history of the language have fully understood the entirety), you’re used to playing by some fairly strictly-enforced, static rules about construction that simply don’t apply in the New Order of Things.</p>

<p>Obvious example: classes and interfaces. In C++, you define interfaces through classes with virtual (usually pure virtual) methods that you then implement in (often multiply-inherited) subclasses. Ruby, done properly, is <em>different</em>; there’s no equivalent, really, to C++’s pure virtual methods (thank <code class="highlighter-rouge">$DEITY</code>); “duck typing” a) makes the “contract” between components much more casually fungible and b) encourages smaller, more atomic classes than you’d typically write in C++. It sounds simple and straightforward, and it <em>is</em> and you <em>think</em> you know all about it — until you’re a few years in and the light bulb finally flips on.</p>

<p>(source: 15+ years coding C++ on a daily basis, and coming up on 5 total years of equivalent Ruby and 2 years of Python experience.)</p>

<p>YMMV. TIKOAR. IANALNDIPOOTV. LSMFT. And, for you Singaporeans, as always, terms and conditions apply<sup>*</sup>.</p>
