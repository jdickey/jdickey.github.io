<p>And that’s a Very Good Thing™ for <em>both</em> language communities. Yes, it’s good to know both languages and to use each where they make sense. But They’re <em>Not</em> The Same Thing. Obvious, yes?</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Abe Voelker wrote a <a href="https://blog.abevoelker.com/you-got-haskell-in-my-ruby-cleaner-ruby-validations-using-either-monad-kleisli-gem/">blog post</a> in which he sang the praises of the <a href="https://github.com/txus/kleisli">Kleisli</a> Gem to, in effect, let you write Haskell code in your Ruby. He started out by demonstrating a “naive” validation object for validating an uploaded image
according to four criteria, verifying that the image:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Has a size of less than one megabyte;</li>
  <li>Is a valid image format;</li>
  <li>Is of type PNG, JPEG, or GIF; and</li>
  <li>Has dimensions of less than 5,000 by 5,000 pixels.</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition, he states a requirement for “a JSON-friendly version of the validation return value as the website is uploading the image via Ajax”.</p>

<p>Fine. Easy enough, without resorting to exotic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJLDF6qZUX0">“Reese’s Pieces”</a> language concoctions.</p>

<h3 id="hasty-rewrite">Hasty Rewrite</h3>

<p>The Gist copied at the end of this post is what I’d consider a <em>first draft</em> of a rewritten <code class="highlighter-rouge">AvatarValidator</code> class. It’s a somewhat more readable version of the original; both are still <em>massive</em> SRP violations. They do too much; they have <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html">leaky abstractions</a> through and through. But this is still an improvement:</p>

<h4 id="command-pattern-and-state-machine">Command Pattern and State Machine</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://blog.abevoelker.com/you-got-haskell-in-my-ruby-cleaner-ruby-validations-using-either-monad-kleisli-gem/#version-1-naive-validation-object">original code</a> made was clearly a classic <a href="https://blog.abevoelker.com/you-got-haskell-in-my-ruby-cleaner-ruby-validations-using-either-monad-kleisli-gem/#version-1-naive-validation-object">command pattern</a>, but implemented in a massive nested-if furball. You had to squint to see that it was implementing a stepwise state machine, with subsequent states being implemented as ever-more-deeply-nested <code class="highlighter-rouge">if</code> blocks.</p>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/jdickey/8eaf646fbd754408c6d9">In the first replacement</a>, the <a href="https://gist.github.com/jdickey/8eaf646fbd754408c6d9#file-avatar_validator_v1-rb-L45-L54"><code class="highlighter-rouge">#validate</code> method</a> (inside the guard clause) is a sequence of calls to <code class="highlighter-rouge">private</code> methods with intention-revealing names that (should) make it easier to find what you’re looking for, or to understand the overall process.</p>

<h4 id="error-detection-and-message-output">Error Detection and Message Output</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://blog.abevoelker.com/you-got-haskell-in-my-ruby-cleaner-ruby-validations-using-either-monad-kleisli-gem/#version-1-naive-validation-object">original code</a> has inline, nested <code class="highlighter-rouge">if</code> statements whose <code class="highlighter-rouge">else</code> clauses each build and return literal strings, more than doubling the length of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">#validate</code> method (lines 10-33) compared with the <a href="https://gist.github.com/jdickey/8eaf646fbd754408c6d9#file-avatar_validator_v1-rb-L45-L54">new implementation</a>. Changes to the original output messages do not originate in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Source_of_Truth">“single source of truth”</a>, which complicates and adds risk to change; are you <em>sure</em> you’ve done everything and <em>only</em> what you set out to do? (Remember, there are <em>no tests yet</em>.)</p>

<p>In the new code, any validation error detected will raise a <code class="highlighter-rouge">RuntimeError</code> whose message <a href="https://gist.github.com/jdickey/8eaf646fbd754408c6d9#file-avatar_validator_v1-rb-L86-L90">encodes</a> <em>an identifier</em> for the error, along with a single relevant data item. The <a href="https://gist.github.com/jdickey/8eaf646fbd754408c6d9#file-avatar_validator_v1-rb-L52-L53">handler</a> for that <code class="highlighter-rouge">RuntimeError</code> calls a <a href="https://gist.github.com/jdickey/8eaf646fbd754408c6d9#file-avatar_validator_v1-rb-L75-L84"><code class="highlighter-rouge">private</code> method</a> that centralises all text strings for error messages, making it easy to change later if needed (e.g, for i18n).</p>

<h4 id="whats-our-input">What’s Our Input?</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://blog.abevoelker.com/you-got-haskell-in-my-ruby-cleaner-ruby-validations-using-either-monad-kleisli-gem/#version-1-naive-validation-object">original code</a> passes in an <code class="highlighter-rouge">uploaded_file</code> parameter, which is assigned to an instance variable (at line 7). That ivar is then used, duck-type style, to find its size (by calling the <code class="highlighter-rouge">#size</code> method at line 12) and by calling the <code class="highlighter-rouge">path</code> method <em>of the return object from <code class="highlighter-rouge">uploaded_file</code>’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">#tempfile</code> method</em> at line 15).</p>

<p>In contrast, the first whack at a replacement <code class="highlighter-rouge">AvatarValidator</code> has a nested class, <a href="https://gist.github.com/jdickey/8eaf646fbd754408c6d9#file-avatar_validator_v1-rb-L7-L38"><code class="highlighter-rouge">AvatarValidator::UploadedFile</code></a>, which reports the <code class="highlighter-rouge">#size</code> (needed for validation) and produces a <a href="https://gist.github.com/jdickey/8eaf646fbd754408c6d9#file-avatar_validator_v1-rb-L16-L18"><code class="highlighter-rouge">MiniMagick::Image</code> instance</a> of the data in the uploaded file (<a href="https://gist.github.com/jdickey/8eaf646fbd754408c6d9#file-avatar_validator_v1-rb-L28-L37">however that file was specified</a>, whether as a blob of data, a filename or an instance of <code class="highlighter-rouge">AvatarValidator::UploadedFile</code> itself).</p>

<h3 id="known-problems">Known Problems</h3>

<ol>
  <li>There are no tests. Even if there were, it’s tedious/dangerous to attempt to test individual validation steps in isolation.</li>
  <li>The image-dimension validation now separately checks height and width, reporting different error messages when invalid; the <a href="https://blog.abevoelker.com/you-got-haskell-in-my-ruby-cleaner-ruby-validations-using-either-monad-kleisli-gem/#version-1-naive-validation-object">original code</a> (see lines 18-19) did not.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">AvatarValidator</code> still has repetitive code. The internal validation-step methods (<a href="https://gist.github.com/jdickey/8eaf646fbd754408c6d9#file-avatar_validator_v1-rb-L96-L99"><code class="highlighter-rouge">#verify_file_size</code></a>, <a href="https://gist.github.com/jdickey/8eaf646fbd754408c6d9#file-avatar_validator_v1-rb-L101-L106"><code class="highlighter-rouge">#validate_image_format</code></a>, <a href="https://gist.github.com/jdickey/8eaf646fbd754408c6d9#file-avatar_validator_v1-rb-L108-L112"><code class="highlighter-rouge">#verify_allowed_format</code></a>, and (to a slightly lesser degree) <a href="https://gist.github.com/jdickey/8eaf646fbd754408c6d9#file-avatar_validator_v1-rb-L114-L119"><code class="highlighter-rouge">#verify_image_dimensions</code></a>) each follow the same pattern: bail out if we’re valid, or call <code class="highlighter-rouge">#fail_with</code> if we’re not.</li>
  <li>This code is unloved by <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/">RuboCop</a>, a widely-used Ruby style checker and our shop standard. In particular, the offence triggered by the <a href="https://gist.github.com/jdickey/8eaf646fbd754408c6d9#file-avatar_validator_v1-rb-L114-L119"><code class="highlighter-rouge">#verify_image_dimensions</code> method</a>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Assignment Branch Condition size for verify_image_dimensions is too high. [16.16/15]</code> is one I have learned to take seriously. RuboCop’s default trigger value of 15 is in fact higher than what you should see if, say, you were following <a href="https://robots.thoughtbot.com/sandi-metz-rules-for-developers">Sandi Metz’ rules</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="coming-soon">Coming Soon</h3>

<p>A new iteration of the rewrite will soon address these problems, and produce code that is neither a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man">straw man</a> to provide a convenient excuse to switch languages, nor code that would budge the WTF-O-Meter® at your team’s code review.</p>
