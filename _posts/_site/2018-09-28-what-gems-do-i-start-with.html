<p>Well, hello again! Excuse the dust…</p>

<p>This post is in response to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/9isbvh/should_i_use_trailblazer/">question on Reddit <code class="highlighter-rouge">r/rails</code></a>, and specifically a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/9isbvh/should_i_use_trailblazer/e6nmfbz/">follow-up question</a> from my response to his initial question. He later asked me to “list the gems [I] use on every project that [make] the code more readable and will let the developer keep his sanity”.</p>

<p>I started out by thinking that I’d just give him a copy of a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gemfile</code> I’m using for a project in its very early stages, where the vast majority of the 30+ Gems listed as direct dependencies are from boilerplate I carry around to every project, with all but one of the rest being the kind of boilerplate he was asking for. Then I thought that hey, <a href="https://rubygems.org">RubyGems.org</a> is a great resource for identifying what individual Gems are and what they depend on, but dumping a list of more than 25 Gems on someone without at least briefly explaining what each is and why it’s in my boilerplate probably wouldn’t be a very effective way to convey useful information. As what I started typing grew longer than I’d want to see in a Reddit post response, I decided I’d better write it as a blog post. So here we are.</p>

<p>To recap, what I enumerate below are Gems I use on practically every Ruby project I’ve started in the last couple of years, whether that project used Rails, <a href="https://hanamirb.org/">Hanami</a>, or <a href="https://roda.jeremyevans.net/">Roda</a>. They’ve each been useful for me and my team, and I expect to be using them individually and collectively until and unless I find something that does the job more to my liking. (Yes, this is largely a subjective list; others may not think you need all this, but give them a try before you dismiss them.)</p>

<p>This turned into a lot more than you asked for; more than I expected to write; and <em>far</em> more than anyone would bother reading in a Reddit comment. Comments, nonetheless, are welcome. Thanks for reading.</p>

<h3 id="testing-features">Testing Features</h3>

<p>It’s <em>essential</em> to have feature specs, which automate “doing things the way a user would do them and verifying the resulting actions/side effects”, especially in a BDD shop. (Doing inside-out TDD instead? How do you prove you’ve finished something correctly if you don’t have feature specs?) It’s important to remember that it’s normal, if a bit disheartening, to have your feature specs fail <em>every single time</em> as you’re in the trenches of building out a new feature; the thing that tells you you’re making progress is that your feature spec makes it <em>farther</em> without falling over.</p>

<p>The de facto feature-spec package for Ruby for <em>many</em> years now has been <a href="https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara">Capybara</a>. To use it with modern applications (i.e., apps which incorporate JavaScript client-side functionality), you need a <em>driver</em> more capable than the default <code class="highlighter-rouge">rack-test</code>; that’s where <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit"><code class="highlighter-rouge">capybara-webkit</code></a> comes in. An alternate, “industrial-strength” driver would be the <a href="https://github.com/shvets/selenium"><code class="highlighter-rouge">selenium</code> Gem</a>, which provides a Ruby wrapper for the <a href="https://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/">Selenium server</a>, which is a Java application.</p>

<p>Docker is your friend.</p>

<h3 id="testing-code">Testing Code</h3>

<p>For the last 3-4 years, I have preferred to use Minitest, particularly Minitest::Spec rather than RSpec. In my experience, it’s faster, more explicit, and therefore easier to understand what it’s doing and why. I also prefer its philosophy of “add separate (Gem-based) enhancements to a minimal core” to what I see as RSpec’s “override the built-in defaults as you like”. That view seems to be a bit less widely-held of late, particularly in the Rails community.</p>

<p>The Minitest enhancement Gems I use are</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/jeremyevans/minitest-hooks"><code class="highlighter-rouge">minitest-hooks</code></a>, which adds <code class="highlighter-rouge">before(:all)</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">after(:all)</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">around</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">around(:all)</code> to Minitest. In any non-toy project, you <em>will</em> find these handy.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/wojtekmach/minitest-matchers"><code class="highlighter-rouge">minitest-matchers</code></a> adds support for <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers">Shoulda</a>/RSpec-style matchers to Minitest::Unit and Minitest::Spec. This style of matcher has been described as “crack cocaine for RSpec, analogous to ActiveSupport for Rails”. This gives you the literate-test-style “high” without the same level of attendant side-effects.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/kern/minitest-reporters"><code class="highlighter-rouge">minitest-reporters</code></a> lets you create <a href="https://github.com/search?q=%22Minitest%3A%3AReporters%3A%3A%22">custom Minitest output formats</a>, or use one or more of the eight that are packaged with the Gem. (Yes, you can run multiple reporters at once. Want a red/green-displaying report <em>and</em> a report that integrates with RubyMine? Got you covered.)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/jbodah/minitest-tagz"><code class="highlighter-rouge">minitest-tagz</code></a> gives you a nice “tagging” capability, perhaps most commonly used to tag examples and groups as <code class="highlighter-rouge">:focus</code>. With a properly-set-up <code class="highlighter-rouge">spec_helper.rb</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">test_helper.rb</code>, this will allow you to run <code class="highlighter-rouge">ruby spec/path/to/your_spec.rb</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">rake spec</code> (or their Minitest::Unit equivalents) and have <em>just</em> the tagged examples run. Indispensable. <em>Be advised that</em> this Gem has a <code class="highlighter-rouge">z</code> at the end; there <em>is</em> a <code class="highlighter-rouge">minitest-tags</code> Gem (with an <code class="highlighter-rouge">s</code>) that hasn’t been updated since Version 0.0.5 in April, 2012. <code class="highlighter-rouge">minitest-tagz</code>, on the other hand, is actively maintained; Version 1.6.0 was released on 9 May.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="other-useful-gems">Other Useful Gems</h3>

<p>Does your app use a database? Then you almost certainly should be using <a href="https://github.com/DatabaseCleaner/database_cleaner"><code class="highlighter-rouge">database_cleaner</code></a>, which does just what it says on the tin: helps you ensure that your integration tests (and any test that touches the database while doing something else <em>is</em> an integration test, remember) clean up after themselves.</p>

<p>Feeling like if you see another <em>John Doe</em> username in tests, you’ll break something expensive? You need <a href="https://github.com/ffaker/ffaker"><code class="highlighter-rouge">ffaker</code></a>, ffriend; this will generate whatever <a href="https://github.com/ffaker/ffaker/tree/master/lib/ffaker">type of data value</a> you need. Korean <em>Lorem Ipsum</em>? People’s names, using either default Western conventions or any of a couple of dozen localisations? Got you covered.</p>

<p>That comes in handy when you get tired of developing and maintaining fixtures and seed data to populate your models during tests. Use [<code class="highlighter-rouge">fabrication](https://www.fabricationgem.org/) (or its better-marketed if less feature-rich analogue, [</code>factory_bot<code class="highlighter-rouge">](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot)) will help. Define the attributes of a model, and you can create an instance based on your template (with or without saving the instance to your database), or simply get a </code>Hash<code class="highlighter-rouge"> with the attribute values.  For example, here's a simple </code>fabrication` User Fabricator from one of my projects:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># frozen_string_literal: true</span>

<span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'securerandom'</span>

  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>See how that works? You can even define field values relative to other field values, as with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">updated_at</code> value being dependent on <code class="highlighter-rouge">created_at</code>, or a “safe” email address being generated based on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">name</code> value. Instantiation can be as simple as <code class="highlighter-rouge">author = Fabricate(:user)</code>. Need thirty User entities all with the same <code class="highlighter-rouge">created_at</code> timestamp but don’t want them to hit the database right away? <code class="highlighter-rouge">students = Fabricate.build(:user, created_at: 3.days.ago)</code> does just what you think it will. Support exists for <a href="https://www.fabricationgem.org/#rails">Rails</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jodosha/hanami-fabrication">Hanami</a>, and a <a href="https://www.fabricationgem.org/#configuration">documented procedure</a> to support any other ORM you may be using.</p>

<h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2>

<p>I <em>can’t stand</em> the <code class="highlighter-rouge">irb</code> console; I much prefer <a href="https://pryrepl.org/">Pry</a>, in the <a href="https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/pry-byebug"><code class="highlighter-rouge">pry-byebug</code></a> enhancement. <code class="highlighter-rouge">pry-byebug</code> is only one of the numerous <a href="https://github.com/pry/pry/wiki/Available-plugins">plugins</a> available for Pry; the only other one I use consistently is <a href="https://github.com/pry/pry-doc"><code class="highlighter-rouge">pry-doc</code></a>, which adds MRI Core documentation and source code to the Pry REPL. There are few learning aids or reminders more effective than <code class="highlighter-rouge">show-source</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">show-doc</code>.</p>

<p>Sometimes you just want good old-fashioned “<code class="highlighter-rouge">printf(3)</code> debugging”, so you can see where things are Going Horribly Wrong in your code/data without actually forcing a debugger breakpoint. For those situations, <a href="https://github.com/awesome-print/awesome_print"><code class="highlighter-rouge">awesome_print</code></a> was my go-to tool for <em>years</em> before I realised that a proper logger like <a href="https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/hanami-utils/Hanami/Logger">Hanami::Logger</a> or <a href="https://rocketjob.github.io/semantic_logger/">Semantic Logger</a> is <em>far</em> more flexible and useful.</p>

<h2 id="static-analysis">Static Analysis</h2>

<p>These are tools I generally use via Rake tasks, or which integrate into tools typically run from Rake, like Minitest. This is <em>probably</em> the most direct answer to the question of what Gems make “the code more readable and will let the developer keep his sanity”, but do read on.</p>

<p>Writing code without static-analysis tools, to me, is very much like driving on the expressway on a dark and foggy night without headlights: if I’m very careful, and <em>very</em> lucky, I can <em>probably</em> get where I’m going without hitting anything of consequence, but all it takes is one unseen obstacle (say, a few bags of cement accidentally dropped from a truck) to ruin my whole night. With a good pair of fog headlights, I’m much more confident of where I’m going.</p>

<p>The tools I use on <em>every</em> project are</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/seattlerb/flog"><code class="highlighter-rouge">flog</code></a> is a complexity metric. As your project grows, its Flog report will show you the classes and methods which are the most complex, with a view towards prodding you to refactor any excessively-highly-Flogged method. Our shop rules define a method score above 7.5 as a <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/code-smells/"><em>code smell</em></a>; not even presumed to be buggy, but more likely to warrant further attention. A score above 12.0 (soon to become 10.0) will block a feature branch from being merged back into <code class="highlighter-rouge">develop</code>. You’ll want to adopt rules that make sense for your shop, and adjust them as you gain experience and as individual projects mature.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/troessner/reek"><code class="highlighter-rouge">reek</code></a> is a general, wide-ranging code-smell detector. With some four dozen or so <a href="https://github.com/troessner/reek#code-smells">smells</a> defined, and with an easy-to-use, flexible <a href="https://github.com/troessner/reek#configuration">configuration</a> scheme, you can use Reek in its default configuration or make it as permissive or strict as your shop standards allow.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/"><code class="highlighter-rouge">rubocop</code></a> is a static code analyser and (perhaps primarily) format enforcer, supporting the guidelines from the community <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/ruby-style-guide">Ruby Style Guide</a> (which is a great resource for new/newish Ruby devs).</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov"><code class="highlighter-rouge">simplecov</code></a> is a simple (<a href="https://grosser.it/2008/04/04/whats-my-coverage-c0-c1-c2-c3-path-coverage/">C0 coverage</a> only) test-coverage checker for Ruby. If tests never exercise your code, especially in a proper BDD or TDD process, then the untested code is <em>anomalous</em>; possibly a bug, but definitely worthy of examining why it’s there. You may not always (especially in a legacy project) always have 100% coverage as reported by your tool, but you <em>should</em> have a shop standard for deciding whether your test coverage (at a method, class/module, and project level) is adequate for your purposes.</li>
  <li>Finally, <a href="https://github.com/seattlerb/flay"><code class="highlighter-rouge">flay</code></a> analyses code for structural similarities. DRY is a Good Thing (once you’ve established you’re not using <a href="https://www.sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction">the wrong abstraction</a>), and Flay points out code that “too-shamelessly” duplicates other code in your project. <em>Any</em> non-zero score here is treated as cause for immediate concern.</li>
</ul>

<p>My current project’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">Rakefile</code> has a default task which looks like</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>spec default: [:spec, :flog, :flay, :reek, :rubocop]
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="but-wait-theres-more">But Wait; There’s More!</h2>

<p>Do you miss the nice date/time arithmetic from ActiveSupport in your non-Rails project? Look no further than <a href="https://github.com/kylewlacy/timerizer"><code class="highlighter-rouge">timerizer</code></a> which delivers on the promise to be a “simple Ruby time helper, just like the Rails ones. You know, without the Rails.”</p>

<p>Are your config files unwieldy to deal with, especially with sensitive data; or do you need to be able to support different environment variable values in different environments (development, test, etc), perhaps because you’re developing a proper <a href="https://12factor.net/">12 Factor</a> app? You’ll find <a href="https://github.com/thekompanee/chamber">Chamber</a> <em>very</em> useful. Protip: install the Git pre-commit hook that won’t let you commit unencrypted secret data. Your auditors can thank me later.</p>

<p>Do you work with or for people who don’t have simple email addresses that can be validated by any of the simple regular-expression matchers out there, <a href="https://www.natashatherobot.com/ruby-email-validation-regex/">buggy</a> or not? Then you’ll find <a href="https://github.com/afair/email_address"><code class="highlighter-rouge">email_address</code></a> probably handles anything you can throw at it, especially when you enable it looking for appropriate DNS <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code> records to match the domain against.</p>

<p>Finally, if you’re not already familiar with it, you should have <a href="https://awesome-ruby.com/">Awesome Ruby</a> near the top of your bookmarks list. A categorised, community-driven, curated list of Gems for most things you’d want to pull off the shelf, and a few that you might not have thought that you could. Part of the awesome <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome">Awesome</a> list of awesome lists, which includes lists on what have to be <em>hundreds</em> of different topics, from your favourite programming technology to <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-scifi#readme">science fiction</a> to <a href="https://github.com/mmccaff/PlacesToPostYourStartup#readme">places to post your startup</a>. (If startups aren’t science fiction, what are they? Well, most of them turn out to be fantasy instead, yes?)</p>
