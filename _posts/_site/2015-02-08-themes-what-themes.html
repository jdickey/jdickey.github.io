<p>Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_(computing)">defines</a> <em>theme</em> as “a preset package containing graphical appearance details”. Jekyll Bootstrap has a wonderful-sounding <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com/usage/jekyll-theming.html">page</a> on “Using Themes”, implying a meaning of “theme” consistent with the Wikipedia definition. The Jekyll Bootstrap <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com/">home page</a> claims that “Jekyll Bootstrap is the first Jekyll blogging engine to support modular theming.”  It’s too bad that the <a href="http://themes.jekyllbootstrap.com/">theme browser</a> includes a mere half-dozen themes that are several years old. A Github search for <a href="https://github.com/search?p=3&amp;q=jekyll+theme&amp;type=Repositories&amp;utf8=✓"><code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll theme</code></a> yields over 550 repository results — which appear to be <em>forks of a Jekyll installation with asset and config changes applied</em>.</p>

<p>Not what most people (or most developers/designers, at least) think a “theme” is.</p>

<p>So why aren’t there gobs of <em>standalone, installable</em> themes out there? How come the world seems to have ended in 2012 for Jekyll theming? (Were the Mayans onto something after all?) The Jekyll Bootstrap docs have <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com/api/theme-api.html">a nice write-up</a> of the Theme API, <em>Version 0.1.0</em>, which recommends that the would-be theme author “[view] and study the repos for current published themes”, linking to a <a href="http://github.com/jekyllbootstrap/">moribund Github repo</a>.</p>

<p>What happened?</p>
