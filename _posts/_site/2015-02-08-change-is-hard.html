<p>It really wasn’t <em>supposed</em> to be this hard. All I wanted to do (famous last words there, yes) was to</p>

<ul>
  <li>consolidate all my various bits of writing in one place;</li>
  <li>have control over how posts were tagged, categorised, and presented;</li>
  <li>not have to fire up a Web site like <code class="highlighter-rouge">blogger.com</code> to create posts;</li>
  <li>use Disqus for comments; and, most importantly</li>
  <li>be able to stop hand-coding raw HTML (at least once I had things set up to my liking) but use Markdown or something very similar instead.</li>
</ul>

  <p>How hard could that be?</p>

<p>Lawyers have a saying that applies to dealing with witnesses: <em>never ask a question you don’t already know the answer to</em>. Software development, and Web development, and blogging, too often are all about not knowing what questions you’re even asking until they bite you where it hurts.</p>

<p>What you are reading here was originally set up using <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com/">Jekyll Bootstrap</a> (hereinafter “JB”). That gave me the <em>illusion</em> of getting up to speed quickly, by defaulting or masking parts of the underlying <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> parsing engine. Jekyll, as the <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com/lessons/jekyll-introduction.html#toc_3">JB introduction</a> takes pains to make clear, is <em>not</em> a blogging engine; it “does not come with any content nor does it have any templates or design elements”. JB itself is a layer on top of Jekyll with support for theming, commenting, and Rake tasks to make nuts-and-bolts work easier.</p>

<p>Jekyll Bootstrap itself is an odd beast; though the <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com/">Web site</a> claims that the latest verion is “0.3.0 released on <em>24 Feb 2012</em>”, and in the <a href="https://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap#version">README</a>, no such release exists in the <a href="https://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap/releases">Github repo’s release list</a>. It’s very confusing for a new user (who wishes to use it for writing) to just come in, pick up a current, stable version, and Get Stuff Done. I accept that there’s a lot of stuff under the Jekyll (and JB) hood that I ought to learn. There’s a lot of <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com/usage/jekyll-quick-start.html">detailed doc</a> for JB. But the “quick start”, as alluded to earlier, gives you the <em>illusion</em> of getting up to speed quickly.</p>

<p>The other major contender for “here’s what you use on top of Jekyll” appears to be <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> which, as the currently most-recent <a href="http://octopress.org/2015/01/15/octopress-3.0-is-coming/">blog entry</a> says,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…is basically some guy’s Jekyll blog you can fork and modify.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He’s in the midst of <a href="https://github.com/octopress/octopress">rebuilding it nearly from scratch</a> as a “selection of gems, each semantically versioned with is own documentation and tests.” (Cue raucous applause and breathless anticipation.) Once Octopress 3.0 is a real thing, you’ll just install a Gem or three, and the Github repo you keep your Octopress site in will just be <em>your stuff</em>, not (as in the case of my current JB-based repo) ~300 commits <em>to which you add your stuff</em>.</p>

<p>Until then, however, I’ve a few questions I need to find answers to, for now in terms of Jekyll Bootstrap:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How can I deploy development branches (and test/view them) without disturbing my public, <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code>-branch-based JB deploy?</li>
  <li>Why can’t my <code class="highlighter-rouge">pages.html</code> file find my posts even though my <code class="highlighter-rouge">tags.html</code> can?</li>
  <li>How come my sidebar isn’t being displayed, even though the markup is basically as-generated by JB?</li>
  <li>What’s the best way to normalise case for tags, to ensure that a capitalisation typo doesn’t either render something difficult to find or clutter up the <code class="highlighter-rouge">tags.html</code> file unhelpfully?</li>
  <li>and so on.</li>
</ul>

<p>If anyone has any suggestions, I’m all ears.</p>
