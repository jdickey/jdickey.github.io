<p>Quick! In a Script source file for Ruby on Rails, what’s the difference between</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">// require supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">//= require supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</code></p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>Typing the first when you meant the second is a “fun” way to spend an hour debugging a nonsense failure. (It’s a lot harder to see when in a forest of other such lines, in 9pt Monaco.)</p>

<p>Give my my 50+-year-old experience with my 20-year-old eyes and watch how fast I crank stuff out.</p>
