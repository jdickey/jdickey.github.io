<p>Programming is a craft that has a disturbing similarity to cultish faith: in both cases, you’re trying to come to some understanding of something that is so much larger and more intricate than anything else you’ve ever thought about thinking about and, as you progress in your journey, you find yourself assigning random occurrences and ideas to the object of your veneration. This can be shown, in both cases, to have highly negative psychological effects on many of its practitioners.</p>
