<p>The ancient Greek philosopher Archimedes is quoted as <a href="http://www.mcs.drexel.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Lever/LeverQuotes.html">having said</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Give me a place to stand and with a lever I will move the whole world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We’re not here to attempt anything on that scale, but being involved in IT often feels that way.</p>

<p>This blog is one of the vehicles which I intend to use to record, discuss and build upon various projects, ideas and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/meme">memes</a> which I believe important in the context of a modern software-development organisation. By the term “software-development organisation”, I am also including groups which create Web applications and content, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcasting">podcasts</a>, or similar “media” artifacts which rely on some form of computer or other electronic technology for distribution.</p>
