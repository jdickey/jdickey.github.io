<blockquote>
  <p>David Heinemeier Hansson discusses his keynote talk and shares some of his thoughts on how Rails is used within the tech industry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good insight into DHH’s thinking… he slams TDD and “dogma” as “not being realistic” and (indirectly) software development <em>as engineering</em> and seems focused on development as compositional writing, as an artisanal creative process. Certainly a viewpoint I can emphathise with… up to a point. Given that the most often-heard criticisms around Rails centre on scalability and sustainability, this explains a lot. He seems to have a fairly consistent issue with conflating a <em>tool</em>, especially the first selected tool, with the <em>practice</em> that tool is meant to support. Hence his hostility to TDD, Kent Beck- and Bob Martin-advocated ideas of “clean code” and “clean architecture”; slamming GPL as “I don’t want to use your code if you don’t want to <em>give</em> it to me”… fundamentally, and consistently, missing the point.</p>

<p>Slamming practices based on mediocre initial tools. I don’t think anyone who learned RSpec or MiniTest first would be happy moving to <em>the original</em> <tt>Test::Unit</tt>. Yes, bad tools often negate huge parts of the benefit of the practice they “support”. But saying “TDD makes software worse” is just <em>asinine</em>.</p>

<p>A revealing, and possibly deeply troubling, discussion. (On the other hand, he’s got conference keynotes and book deals I don’t, so “success”. I don’t want to come across as sour grapes, but the more I work with Rails, the more troubled about it, and the ecosystem/community built around it, I become.)</p>
