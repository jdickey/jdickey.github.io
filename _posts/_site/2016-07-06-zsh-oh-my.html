<p>I first heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell">Zsh</a> and <a href="http://ohmyz.sh">oh my zsh</a> in the late ’00s, dismissing it as I was happy enough with <code class="highlighter-rouge">bash</code> (being a Version 7 UNIX Bourne shell veteran, not long after Hollerith codes were a ubiquitous thing). I had aliases; used a lot of shell functions and had a home-baked system for organising and managing them; and even had my <code class="highlighter-rouge">bash</code> prompt tell me what Git branch I was on and how many unstaged/untracked files there were. Why did I need to change?</p>

<p>Then I came across a Medium/Free Code Camp article, <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.com/d-oh-my-zsh-af99ca54212c#.jad839q5c"><em>d’Oh My Zsh</em></a>, which described the history and some of the unique features, and further reminded me that I could install it and “take it for a spin” before committing myself with the psychologically important (yet reversible!) <code class="highlighter-rouge">chsh</code>. So I did. And some three months on, I don’t <em>want</em> to go back. It’s not that any single feature is particularly mindblowing, or that I can’t sit here and think of a way to implement it—but the <em>collection</em> and openness of the features, plugins, and themes, is a serious productivity <em>and fun</em> boost.</p>

<p>As a simple example: I routinely used to have a dozen or (often) more Terminal tabs open in different windows, so that I could context-switch and multitask. (In reality, several of those tabs had been open for <em>months</em> without doing anything demonstrably useful.) After reading the Medium article, I read the docs (yeah, I’m one of <em>those</em> people) and linked sites. I realised that the (bundled) <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/plugins/jump/jump.plugin.zsh"><code class="highlighter-rouge">jump</code> plugin</a> could clean that clutter (and memory use); just mark a directory, and it’s added to a list that you can display as “Here’s all the stuff I think I ought to be poking at”. Now I’m down to one or two tabs open (the second is needed only when running some sort of server for development), and it’s a lot easier for me to stay focused and find my way around. Win! (I may one day get around to forking/hacking the plugin itself; I’d like for the <code class="highlighter-rouge">marks</code> list-all-marks command to display the timestamp each symlink was created at, so I can focus on and clean out older items of past interest.)</p>

<p>And command completion is <em>amazingly</em> better than with <code class="highlighter-rouge">bash</code>; you don’t know what you’re missing (and I’m not likely to sell you on it) without you giving it a spin for a few days to try out. Software should be both fun and useful; this is.</p>

<p>Dead-finger tech to go on the short list of such.</p>
