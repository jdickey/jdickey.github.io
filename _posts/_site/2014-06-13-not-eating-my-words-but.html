<p>…thinking some people might wonder if I’m nibbling on the punctuation.</p>

<p>The comment above an internal class-within-a-class (in Ruby) I’m just finishing off reads:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    <span class="c1"># Information about a blog entry, currently only body and title. This is</span>
    <span class="c1"># a *subset* of what's stored in the database (e.g., no timestamps), and</span>
    <span class="c1"># is meant to quack properly to code that wants to *think* of a thing as a</span>
    <span class="c1"># blog post, but has no business whatever touching the actual machinery.</span>
    <span class="c1"># This is arguably a permissible violation of the Law of Leaky</span>
    <span class="c1"># Abstractions, invoking the Interface Segregation Principle.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID">SOLID</a> is a <em>basic</em> tool of minimal developer proficiency. So, in my view, is Spolsky’s <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html">Law of Leaky Abstractions</a> — <em>except</em> where it contravenes SOLID (usually the ISP).</p>

<p>Dissenters?</p>
