Quick! In a Script source file for Ruby on Rails, what's the difference between

> `// require supercalifragilisticexpialidocious`

and

> `//= require supercalifragilisticexpialidocious`

Typing the first when you meant the second is a "fun" way to spend an hour debugging a nonsense failure. (It's a lot harder to see when in a forest of other such lines, in 9pt Monaco.)

Give my my 50+-year-old experience with my 20-year-old eyes and watch how fast I crank stuff out.
