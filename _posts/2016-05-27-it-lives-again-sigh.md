If you can see this, you're *not* too close; we're just back on the air with GitHub Pages.

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) itself is a surprisingly straightforward blogging system, considering the fact that every single Jekyll blog in existence is a fork of someone *else's* blog (including templates which are blogs stripped of content). Attempting to customise them haphasardly, especially when combined with the niceties of Github Pages, however, gives one a finely-crafted weapon of mass distraction. The target of that distraction will likely be yourself; I'm still experimenting here, but I've finally found a "theme" (content-free template) [dbyll](https://github.com/dbtek/dbyll) by [@dbtek](https://github.com/dbtek) (Ä°smail Demirbilek) that has the features I've been looking for from plugins (which aren't supported by GitHub Pages): tags, categories, enhanced contact info, and (coming soon), my CV.

In the meantime, let me know how this looks, and enjoy your voyage aboard Kobayashi Maru. What is this, our fifth tour?
