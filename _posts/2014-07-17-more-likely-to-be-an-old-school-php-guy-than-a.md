There's something about a community culture that, more often than not, treats a lack of tests as a defect in itself, compared to one that's been ravaged by "Have a WEBSITE for $10"- and "Learn *X* in 21 Seconds"-level stupidity.

Yes, I'm aware that tools are maturing and that there are several folks in the PHP community putting in *legendary* effort to change attitudes. I truly wish them luck; they're going to need more than the world has yet known.
