# jdickey.github.io

Theme based on [`dbyll`](http://dbtek.github.io/dbyll/) by [Ä°smail Demirbilek](https://github.com/dbtek). See the theme-project link for details.

# Setup

## Prerequisites

1. A currently-supported version of MRI Ruby (as of late March 2017, the current releases of the 2.1.*x* through 2.4.*x* branches);
2. The [`rbenv`](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) Ruby environment manager;
3. The [`gemset`](https://github.com/jf/rbenv-gemset) plugin for `rbenv`. The [`ruby-build`](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build) plugin is **recommended** but not required.

## Getting Set Up

Simply run the `bin/setup` script in this repository. That will

1. create an `rbenv` Gemset to help keep the system-wide Gem repository pristine;
2. install the Gems that are directly and indirectly depended on. Direct dependency versions are fully specified as of the last time the setup script was updated; and
3. run `bundle install` to bundle Jekyll *locally,* using the Gems that were just installed into the Gemset.
